# SecondWaveOS

Turn any old Android phone into a plug-and-play personal cloud: headless setup via USB-C, prebuilt device
images, a friendly desktop installer, global HTTPS access via outbound tunnels, and simple public file sharing
links — no router changes required.

SecondWaveOS breathes new life into obsolete or damaged‑but‑functional smartphones — transforming them into headless, personal cloud servers that are private, secure, and easy to set up.
Built for privacy-conscious individuals, small teams, and makers, it’s designed to be as simple as plugging in via USB‑C and following a quick first‑boot wizard.
